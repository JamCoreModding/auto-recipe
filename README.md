_**Automated recipe serializers for a more painless data driven experience.**_

Auto Recipe is a library that creates recipe serializers for you based on annotations, removing a lot of the boilerplate of creating custom recipe types.

Jam Core's fork of Auto Recipe is an updated version of the original, unmaintained, version of Auto Recipe, created with consent from the original author, [Emi](https://github.com/emilyploszaj).
